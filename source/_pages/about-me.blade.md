## Who Am I?

<img class="text-img-left" style="max-width: 200px;" src="/images/patrick-stephan-sq.jpg" alt="Patrick Stephan"> I am a self taught web developer. My career started with simple websites and progressed as I learned Flash Actionscript 3, PHP, MySQL and Javascript. Programming became a large part of my life when I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PHP-MySQL-Dummies-Computer-Tech/dp/0470096004/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"PHP &amp; MySQL for Dummies"</a>. I started off building applications in the late 00's on completely procedural code. I slowly started getting better as I followed other developers on Twitter and learned the CodeIgniter and <a href="https://www.laravel.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Laravel</a> PHP frameworks, and the AngularJS and Vue.js Javascript frameworks.

I live in the St Louis, Missouri area, go to church regularly, and love to spend time with my wife, Mandy, and baby girl, Abigail. I also enjoy amateur photography, the outdoors, and international cuisines.

## What do I do?

I am a full time developer. I currently work for <a href="http://www.metrogistics.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metrogistics</a>, a vehicle transportation brokerage company, where I help build and maintain all of the company's internal applications. I specialize in building web based applications with Laravel and Vue.JS and I really enjoy building SPAs (single page applications).

I have worked for a couple of web development firms in the past: <a href="http://www.blusolutions.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BluSolutions</a>, an agency specializing in car dealership websites, and <a href="https://www.prochurch.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Divine Design (now ProChurch)</a>, an agency specializing in church websites.
